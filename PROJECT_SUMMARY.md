# Canva Editor: Complete Enhancement Summary

## Project Overview

This Canva Editor project is a comprehensive React-based design tool with the following key features:

### Core Architecture

- Created `BlurIcon.tsx` and `BackdropBlurIcon.tsx` components
- Updated `TransformLayer.tsx` and `RenderLayer.tsx` to apply CSS filters
- Added UI controls in `CommonSettings.tsx` with sliders (0-20px range)

**Files Modified:**

- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\types\layer.ts`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\layers\core\TransformLayer.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\layers\core\RenderLayer.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\utils\settings\CommonSettings.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\icons\BlurIcon.tsx`

- Real-time preview in the editor
- Intuitive slider controls in the properties panel

### 2. Enhanced Background Sync System ✅

**Major Improvements:**

- Reduced server sync interval from 60s to 15s (4x more frequent)
- Added comprehensive event handling for all scenarios
- Implemented forced sync before critical actions
- Enhanced mobile and cross-platform support
- Added emergency save with Beacon API

**New Event Handlers:**

- `visibilitychange` - Tab switching, window minimizing
- `pagehide` - Mobile-optimized page unload
- `orientationchange` - Mobile device rotation
- `blur` - Window focus loss
- `resume`/`pause` - Mobile app lifecycle
- Enhanced `beforeunload` - Better user warnings

**Critical Action Integration:**

- PNG exports (single and multiple pages)
- PDF exports
- Design downloads (JSON)
- Template saves
- Video exports (Remotion)

**Files Modified:**

- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\services\syncService.ts`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\hooks\useSyncService.ts`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\layout\sidebar\components\HeaderFileMenu.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\components\editor\DesignFrame.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\components\editor\CanvaEditor.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\packages\editor\src\components\editor\RemotionPreview.tsx`
- `k:\2025\canva-editor\api\app.js`

**New Functions:**

- `forceSyncBeforeCriticalAction()` - Ensures data sync before exports/downloads
- Emergency save endpoint `/api/emergency-save` - Beacon API support
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

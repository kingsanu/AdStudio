# Design Auto-Save Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that the current design is automatically saved to the database before performing critical actions like WhatsApp campaigns, downloads, bulk coupon generation, kiosk publishing, and live menu publishing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Design Save Helper Utility (`src/utils/designSaveHelper.ts`)

This utility provides three main functions:

- **`saveDesignBeforeAction`**: Saves design data to the server using the sync service
- **`getCurrentDesignData`**: Extracts serialized design data from the editor query
- **`ensureDesignSaved`**: Combines the above functions to ensure a design is saved before proceeding with an action

### 2. Modified CustomHeader Component (`src/components/editor/CustomHeader.tsx`)

Updated the following handlers to save designs before proceeding:

- **`handleDownload`**: Saves design before triggering download
- **`handleShare`**: Saves design before opening WhatsApp campaign dialog
- **`handlePublishKiosk`**: Saves design before opening kiosk publish dialog
- **`handlePublishLiveMenu`**: Saves design before opening live menu publish dialog
- **`handleBulkGenerate`**: Saves design before bulk coupon generation

### 3. Updated CustomCanvaEditor Component (`src/components/editor/CustomCanvaEditor.tsx`)

- Modified prop types to include editor context in callbacks
- Updated header props to pass editor context for design serialization

### 4. Enhanced NewEditor Component (`src/pages/Editor/NewEditor.tsx`)

Added new handler functions that receive editor context:

- **`handleDownloadFromEditor`**: Wrapper for download with design saving
- **`handleShareFromEditor`**: Wrapper for sharing with design saving  
- **`handleBulkGenerateFromEditor`**: Wrapper for bulk generation with design saving

## How It Works

1. **User Triggers Action**: User clicks WhatsApp Campaign, Download, or Bulk Generate button
2. **Design Saving**: The system automatically captures the current design data and saves it to the database
3. **Validation**: The system verifies the save was successful
4. **Action Proceeds**: Only if the save is successful, the requested action proceeds
5. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications inform the user of save status

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures designs are never lost when creating campaigns or downloads
- **Consistency**: All design-dependent actions now follow the same save-first pattern
- **User Experience**: Automatic saving removes the burden from users to manually save
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents actions from proceeding with unsaved/stale design data

## API Integration

The implementation leverages the existing sync service (`syncChangesToServer`) which:

- Stores design data to IndexedDB for offline capability
- Syncs to the server database via POST/PUT requests
- Handles retries and error scenarios
- Provides progress feedback

## Usage Examples

### WhatsApp Campaign
```typescript
// User clicks "WhatsApp Campaign" button
// 1. Design is automatically saved
// 2. Campaign dialog opens with saved design reference
// 3. Campaign uses the saved design for media generation
```

### Download
```typescript
// User clicks "Download" button  
// 1. Design is automatically saved
// 2. Download proceeds with current design state
// 3. User gets the most up-to-date version
```

### Bulk Coupon Generation
```typescript
// User clicks "Bulk Generate" button
// 1. Design is automatically saved
// 2. Coupon template is stored in database
// 3. Bulk generation references the saved template
```

## Error Handling

- **Save Failures**: If design save fails, the action is cancelled and user is notified
- **Network Issues**: Offline changes are queued and synced when connection returns
- **Validation**: Missing design data prevents actions from proceeding

## Testing

A test utility is provided at `src/utils/designSaveHelper.test.ts` for validating the functionality.

## Future Enhancements

- **Progress Indicators**: Show save progress for large designs
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits in multi-user scenarios
- **Version History**: Track design versions for rollback capability
- **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline editing and sync capabilities
